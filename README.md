# Google-Docs-Rainbow
Lets you color text in a Google Doc as a rainbow. Requires [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to run from source, or just download [the .exe](rainbow.exe). 

Line your mouse up with the caret, right click, and press Esc when done. Looks like it's not working on larger docs, but rest assured, it is still working even if you can't see it immediately.
